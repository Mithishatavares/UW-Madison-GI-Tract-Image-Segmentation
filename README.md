# UW-Madison-GI-Tract-Image-Segmentation
Track healthy organs during scans to enhance the treatment of cancer.
To automatically partition the stomach and intestines on MRI scans,we have created a deep learning model. 
The MRI scans come from real cancer patients who underwent 1 to 5 MRI scans over the course of their radiation therapy on various days. 
The programme uses a dataset of these scans to develop innovative deep learning solutions that will improve the care given to cancer patients.
